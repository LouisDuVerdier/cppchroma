# Contributing to cppchroma

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document explains how you can help improve this project.

## Reporting bugs

If you found a bug, I'd be very interested to know about it.

Feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/LouisDuVerdier/cppchroma/issues) explaining what went wrong. The more context you provide, the easier for me it'll be to try to solve the issue, so don't hesitate to add as much as you feel required.

## Pull requests

If you wish to contribute, I encourage you to first open an issue [here](https://github.com/LouisDuVerdier/cppchroma/issues) explaining what you wish to achieve. I wouldn't want you to start doing some heavy work without we had the opportunity to discuss about it.

In terms of coding style, I'd just advise try to respect a bit how it's done around to fit into the existing (4 spaces, no tabs, etc.).

## Licensing

## Credits
